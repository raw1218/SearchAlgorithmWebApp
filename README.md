#React Search Algorithm Visualizer
This is a web application built with React that allows users to visualize search algorithms on a grid or a node-link diagram. The app consists of two pages - a grid page and a node-link diagram page. The app currently supports the following search algorithms:
*Breadth-First Search
*Depth-First Search


#Grid Page
The grid page allows users to set the start and end cells, choose obstacle cells, and create a maze. The user can also choose the grid size.
#Node-Link Diagram Page
The node-link diagram page uses D3 force to create a graph where users can set the nodes and the links between them. Just like the grid page, the user can choose the start and end cells. The user can also create a clustered pattern of nodes and links.
